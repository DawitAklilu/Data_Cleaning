# Data_Cleaning
<h2>My assesment so far is that there is still too much information. It looks like the data doesn't make too much sense as there are price values of 0 which would mean the car is free. We would also have to filter out the odometer readings as we want reasonable values that aren't too high (we can look up the average odometer rating most cars and especially from the data this was taken from)
